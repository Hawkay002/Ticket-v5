## 📖 Overview

This is a serverless, single-file web application designed for exclusive events. It replaces clunky spreadsheets with a sleek, dark-themed dashboard that runs in any browser.

**Why this stands out:**
* **✨ Premium Aesthetics:** "Midnight Void" dark theme with glassmorphism panels and the modern 'Outfit' typeface.
* **⚡ Real-Time Sync:** Data updates instantly across the check-in desk and security scanners using Firebase Firestore.
* **🔒 Admin-Only Security:** Public registration is disabled. Only specific authorized emails can access the dashboard.

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites
* A Google/Firebase Account.
* A GitHub Account (for hosting).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hawkay002/Ticket-backend.git
cd Ticket-backend
```

### Step 2: Firebase Configuration
1.  Go to **Firebase Console**.
2.  Create a project and register a Web App (`</>`).
3.  **Database:** Create a Firestore Database in "Test Mode".
4.  **Auth:** Enable Email/Password authentication.
5.  **Users:** Manually add your admin email/password in the Firebase Console (Users tab).
    * *Note: The app code has public registration disabled for security.*

### Step 3: Link the Code
Open `index.html` and find the configuration section. Replace it with your keys:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  // ... other keys
};
```

### Step 4: Add Custom Sounds (Optional)
To enable premium audio feedback, add these two files to your root folder (next to `index.html`):
* `success.mp3` – Plays on valid entry.
* `error.mp3` – Plays on invalid/duplicate entry.

*(If these files are missing, the system will automatically fall back to generated electronic beeps).*
