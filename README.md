## 🧭 1. Executive Overview

The **Event Ticketing System** is a real-time, browser-based operational dashboard designed for **controlled-access events** such as private gatherings, weddings, conferences, and high-footfall venues.

Unlike generic form-based tools, this system operates as a **live command center**, combining:

- ⚡ Instant ticket issuance  
- 📱 Hardware-free QR entry scanning  
- 👁️ Real-time staff presence monitoring  
- 🔒 Remote device and feature control  
- 🧾 Full forensic activity logging  

The application is optimized for **speed, clarity, and control**, enabling smooth operation even in low-light, high-pressure event environments.

---

## 🎨 2. Design Philosophy

The system follows a **“Midnight Void”** design language:

- 🌑 Deep dark background (`#050505`) for reduced eye strain  
- 🪟 Glass-like UI panels using blur and transparency  
- ✨ Subtle star-field animation for spatial depth  
- 🚦 High-contrast feedback for instant decision-making  

The goal is **zero distraction for staff** and **maximum situational awareness for administrators**.

---

## 🧱 3. System Architecture (High Level)

### 🖥️ Client
- Single-page web application  
- Runs on modern mobile and desktop browsers  
- No native app installation required  

### ☁️ Backend
- Firebase Firestore (real-time NoSQL database)  
- Firebase Authentication (email/password)  

### 🔄 Sync Model
- All clients subscribe to live database updates  
- Any action reflects instantly across devices  
- No manual refresh or polling required  

---

## 🔐 4. Authentication & Access Control

### 🔑 4.1 Multi-Layer Login Flow

#### Layer 1: Email Authentication
- Secure login using Firebase Authentication  
- Only pre-created users can log in  

#### Layer 2: Identity Verification (Gatekeeper)
- Non-admin users must verify a **staff username**  
- Username is cross-checked against the logged-in email  
- Access is denied on mismatch  

This prevents:
- 🚫 Credential sharing  
- 🎭 Staff impersonation  
- 📵 Unauthorized access  

---

### 🧑‍✈️ 4.2 Roles & Isolation

| Role | Access Scope |
|---|---|
| 👑 **Admin** | Full control, logs, locks, reset |

Role logic is enforced at the UI and data-access level.
