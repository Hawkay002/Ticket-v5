## 📖 Overview

This project is a serverless, single-file event ticketing system
designed for private or high-end events. It replaces spreadsheets and
fragile manual workflows with a smooth, dark-themed dashboard that runs
on any modern browser.

**Why this stands out:** 
- ✨ **Premium Look**: Uses a "Midnight Void"
theme featuring animated stars, frosted-glass panels, and the 'Outfit'
font.
- ⚡ **Instant Updates**: Every ticket action syncs live across
devices via Firebase Firestore.
- 🔒 **Secure Access Only**: No public
signup; only pre-approved admin emails can access the system.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎟️ Smart Ticket Issuance

-   Creates a holographic-style digital pass with guest details and a QR
    code.
-   Smooth WhatsApp workflow:
    -   Converts the pass into a PNG using html2canvas.
    -   Downloads automatically.
    -   Opens WhatsApp with a ready-to-send message.
    -   Resets the form for the next guest.

### 📸 Advanced Entry Scanner

-   Uses the device camera directly in the browser.
-   Validates QR codes in real time with Firestore.
-   Audio alerts:
    -   🟢 Beep for a valid scan.
    -   🔴 Buzzer for duplicate/invalid scans.
-   Marks guests as "Arrived" instantly to avoid repeat entries.

### 📊 Guest List Management

-   Live-updating table that syncs across all logged-in devices.
-   Filters by status (Arrived, Coming Soon, Absent) or gender.
-   Sorts by name, age, date added, and more.
-   Bulk delete or export tools.
-   Optionally auto-marks guests as Absent after a deadline.

### 📂 Universal Data Export

Export the guest list in any of these formats:

-   `.xlsx`
-   `.pdf`
-   `.csv`
-   `.json`
-   `.doc`
-   `.txt`

### 🛡️ Security & Access Control

-   **Master Lock** for hiding sensitive tabs like Guest List and
    Config.
-   Cloud-synced master password for all devices.
-   Device-level persistence so locked tabs stay locked even after
    refresh.

### 📱 Responsive & Robust

-   Looks good on laptops and phones.
-   Slide-out tray with quick call and WhatsApp actions.
-   Connection watchdog with offline indicator.
-   Toast notifications for important actions.
